## Michigan Snowboard Club Code of Conduct

## DO’S
- **Be respectful**. This not only means respecting the MSC officers trying to create a safe environment for all of our members but also respecting any and all members / prospective members on trips and at events! 
- **Be inclusive and welcoming**. As long as someone has an interest in winter sports or even just enjoys being around MSC members, they are welcome, so show them that!
- **Look out for one another**. A key aspect of snowboarding culture! You can’t have stoke without safety and community. If someone looks distressed or unsafe on the slopes or at a social event, take action or let an officer know. 
- **Know your limits!** We are unfortunately not Michigan Rager Club. The officers are not your babysitters, so please, both on and off the slopes, make smart decisions regarding behavior and intoxication.
- **Be open**. The best part about MSC culture is that we’re open to all sorts of perspectives! Just because someone has a different opinion, does not give anyone the right to become rude or hostile.
