Whether you ski, board, or have never tried either, Michigan Snowboard Club is the place to be. MSC has been preserving snowboard culture on campus since 1991 and every year the club grows bigger and better. With over 300 members, we remain the largest winter sports organization on campus. Dues are $50 annually and get you access to dozens of social functions, rail jams, and film premieres, along with local trips to Michigan slopes, MLK weekend in Canada, and spring break out west. 

**Shredders of all skill levels welcome.** Letâ€™s SEND 'ER BUD.
