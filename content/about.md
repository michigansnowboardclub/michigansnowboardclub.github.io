Whether you ski, board, or have never tried either, there is no reason not to join the best club on campus. Every year the club grows bigger and better. With over 260 members, we remain the largest winter sports organization on campus. Dues are $40 annually and get you access to our rail jams, film premiers, dozens of local trips to resorts, and annual trips over Martin Luther King weekend and Spring Break.

Nothing is better than getting out of Ann Arbor for a day or an afternoon on the slopes. We hope you choose to join the most stoked crew on campus!

**Skiers and snowboarders of all skill levels are welcome!**
